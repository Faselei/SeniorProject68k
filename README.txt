This is the dev kit as of 01/04/22

INSTALLATION:
	simple:	 unzip to the C drive, should be C:\GenesisRoot\
		 does not modify %PATH% variable

	complex: unzip anywhere, but you must modify the %PATH% variable
		 to include a path to where you unzipped this dev kit too.

NEW PROJECT:
To make a new project, just copy the GameName folder to the same GenesisRoot
top directory. I.E it is suppost to be in the same folder as \bin and \lib.
Then rename the directory to what you want the game to be called.

FILE HIERARCHY:
The Root of the SDK should contain the following:

\bin                    -- contains all windows exe's to build the games
\GameName               -- contains a blank project
\lib                    -- contains the library
\Tools & Manuals        -- contains emulators, web links, and manuals
LICENSE                 -- MIT license
README.txt              -- This readme


PROJECT FILE BREAKDOWN:
Inside of \GameName -or- whatever you call your game

\bin            -- the final game binary is here
\err            -- error listing in assembly, C errors are on the terminal
\obj            -- object files generated by assembler
\src            -- source files of both .asm and .c type
\src\tmp        -- DO NOT DELETE, temporary files from compiler to assembler
makefile        -- the magic file that builds the game
run make clean  -- removes everything from \bin \err \obj \src\tmp
run make        -- runs the makefile to build game
